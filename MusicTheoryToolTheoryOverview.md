## Quick intro to music.

1. There are 12 notes in the 12 TET (12 tonal even temperment) music system
2. Each note is a pitch
3. The 13th note is an octive higher 
4. A scale is any pattern out of the 12 notes
5. The chromatic scale is all of the 12 notes

As the music system is circular in nature, there really is no begining or end. So overtime, people have tried to make sense of this so there is a common language to describe which note should be played on an instrument. 

So the introduction of the musical alphabet worked well (although there have been many different attempts at it)

The musical alphabet is A,B,C,D,E,F & G. 

OK, but we need an anchor so we know what pitch we are referring to.

A = 440 Hz :) When you hear 440 Hz, then you are hearing the international standard given to A from the musical alphabet.

However, if hear 220 Hz, or 660 Hz, we, as humans, interpret that to be the same note, just an octave higher.

OK, so to more precise, 440 Hz = A4. Where 4, denotes the octave. 
So, A3 = 220 Hz, A5 = 660 Hz, and so on.

When we are dealing with music theory, we can drop the octave bit and just cycle through the alphabet. We can decide what octave of a note is played when we compose the music.  

## Intervals
Music is not only circular in nature, but we, as humans associate a tune by the intervals the artist used to create the tune. The smallest interval is a semi-tone, so we can say the chromatic scale is made up of 12 semi-tones. Including intervals in our understanding of music theory is powerful.

Intervals have a system behind them also which help make sense of the music system.

For intervals, we have to introduce an anchor note, this is referred to as the "Root".

Other notes are measured from the "Root" note as intervals
* The 1st 2 semi-tones above the "Root" fall into the "1st" interval (I know right...)
* The 3rd and 4th semi-tones above the "Root" fall into the "2nd" interval
* The 5th semi-tone above the "Root" is the "4th" interval
* The 6th semi-tone above the "Root" is known as the "tri-tone", it doesn't have an interval name
* The 7th semi-tone above the "Root" is the "5th" interval
* The 8th and 9th semi-tone above the "Root" fall into the "6th" interval
* The 10th and 11th semi-tone above the "Root" fall into the "7th" interval
* And the 12th semi-tone above the "Root" is the octave

If we keep going up the semi-tones, we can reach the extended intervals
* And the 13th and 14th semi-tone above the "Root" is the 8th, and so on. 

The pattern alway remains the same. i.e.

## Scales

As we said previously, a scale is any pattern of the 12 TET notes. If we take all 12 notes, then this is the Chromatic scale. We can devise any pattern and give it a name, and that is our scale. (you can invent your own, no one is stopping you...) 

A good way to describe a scale pattern is by its whole-note (W) and half-note (H), where a half-note is a semi-tone.

The chormatic scale is H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H (all half notes)

There are patterns that have been devised an named already that we can use. The most popular being the "Major" scale. 
Starting at a "Root" note, the scale is W-W-H-W-W-W-H

And here is the problem. When we write this out, we cannot describe the circular nature of music. When we descibe it as W-W-H-W-W-W-H, it looks like there is a start and end. There isn't the pattern repeats into infinity...

When we picturize this pattern, we can see whats going on.

We immeditely see that we can start anywhere on the major pattern and cycle round indefinately. If we start on the 3 "degree" of the pattern, we are actually following a "Minor" type pattern. 

## Modes

Modes are seen as an advanced music theory subject, but we immeditely see all the modes in a scale. Each degree of the scale is called a "Mode". Thats it nothing else to modes. 

## Keys

The "Root" matters in music, the root provides the human ear with a grounding to hear intervals from. In order to start to communicate music, a combination of the "Root" and "Scale" is necessary. This combination is known as the "Key". 

## Chords, appeggios

We immeditely see chords and appegios. These are just a combination of notes played from a scale. We can make any chord, and name it given the intervals.

## Circle of fifths

The circle of fifths show a "difficult" way to combine notes and chords so they are diatonic (i.e. fall onto the same notes as in the scale). If you understand the intervals, the circle of fifths does not add much value (IMO).
