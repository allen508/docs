# Music theory tool - Motivations

## My journey with the guitar (so far...)
I didn't have a particulary musical up bringing. I was encouraged by my parents to play violin and piano at my secondary school, but it was happy to just learn some basics. Follow the music teacher in playing some notes, or chords. Having to commit basic chords to memory was a huge turn-off. If music was just commiting patterns to memory and out pops a tune, then I was happy to leave that to others. I mostly listened to pop music, liked how the latest chart release made me feel when I listened to it, and that was enough for me.

### First guitars and early years

In my late teens, I remember visiting a friend who had an electric guitar. He would play bits of songs which I thought was cool. The guiatr licks we're cool, but I was more interested in how the guitar functioned as an instrument.

I brought up my first guitar in University. It was a cheap classical guitar from a second-hand shop, but it was all I needed to get hooked and pass the time during lectures. At first I stuggled how to tune it, I struggled to play a chord. I remember the feeling in my hands felt all wrong, I thought things like, "my fingers are in such an uncomfortable position, surely this isn't how musicians play there songs. It must be agony for them". 

As I pushed on over the years, it got easier. My hands adapted to playing chords, and switching quicker between them. I was happy when I could play along with songs in the charts, practicing to get them to sound similar, searching up the song chords and tabs online. When a chord resonated with the song, it was highly encouraging, and kept me motivated. 

My second guitar as a Crafter beginner guitar. I remember the strings being so sharp and the action so high, that my fingertips would burn after playing it. I would go back to playing my classical often.


### My first real guitar

I had a friend who designed, manufactured and fitted his own guitar pickups. He was working with a new guitar maufacturer from Korea (Ashbury Guitars) and they had sent him a demo guitar to test fit his pickup. I wrote a website for his business in my spare time, and as the guitar was surplus to his requirements, so I took it as payment.

The guitar, although made from the cheaper cherry wood, was actually well made. The neck was thinner, the action felt great, the frets were level. I felt like this was something I could play into the evenings and really enjoy the time, and I did. For 10+ years, I advanced my song scope, playing Kate Bush, Talking Heads, any pop song, I could inject feeling into the playing to replicate the artists. 

But I never understood the guitar. It was pattern recognision instead of knowledge. 

Instead of learning why the music worked, I would focus on practical knowledge. I programmed a guitar tuning app and learnt the physics of vibration, frequency, pitchs, etc... I started making guitars in my spare time, reading about intonation, and how to layout frets to meet a scale.

All this got me thinking, I know nothing about music and how it relates to the guitar... I was going to have to deep-dive into music theory and practically match it up to how the instrument functions.

I went back with the basics of learning the guitar. I sought out a local guitar teacher. 

This motivated me to actually learn music, and try to make my own pieces.


### Discovering the mechanics of music

I started researching online content for learning music. I watched a series on YouTube which explained the circle of fifth, I started learning about music intervals, reading sheet music, etc... What I found was a very confusing landscape of nemoclarure. There is no unicutous language for music. Even theory books get naming of musical concepts mixed. 

On to of that, music seems to be taught through a particular method. That is, for the student to not understand the fundementals of music theory, but to memorise the output of the theory. 

For example:

How are sheet musical staves tought to a student? Memorise a nmonic. "Every Good Boy Deserves Football"
How are the guitar strings tought? Memorise a nmonic. "Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie"
How is the circle of fifths taught? Memorise a nmominic. "Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle"

This is limiting, and I hate having to remember stuff.

I leaned on what I had learnt previously about pitches, frequencies etc, combined with learning interval theory to put together a tool that helped make music theory simple for me. It was also the necessary step to actually understand how the guitar is built around musical theory, and why it is such an amazing instrument.
